h1. OrientDB / Spring integration

h2. About the project

_spring-orientdb_ is an attempt to provide a PlatformTransactionManager for OrientDB useable with the Spring Framework, in particular with _@Transactional_ annotation.

h3. Configuration and usage

Sample configuration & usage coming soon in a separate package. Stay tuned!

h3. Service & DAO

SampleService is annotated as _@Transactional_, so Spring will wrap every method invocation in a OrientDB-powered transaction, and provides an instance of ODatabaseComplex to subclasses of OrientDbDaoSupport.

h2. Disclaimer

*WARNING*: this is my first attempt at the implementation of such a complex beast like a transaction manager, so *USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!*

* I'm not an expert in Spring internals;
* I'm not an expert in OrientDB;
* I just think that Spring & OrientDB are very cool projects that somehow need to work better together.
